## CVE Disclosures 🛡️

Welcome to the CVE disclosures section of this repository! Here, you'll find a list of potential security vulnerabilities that I have discovered.

Below is a list of all the CVEs that I have discovered. Each entry links to a dedicated file inside the `cves/` directory where technical details, timeline, mitigations and references are provided (PoCs are published only when safe and permitted).

| Finding | Description |
|---|---|
| *(No public entries yet)* | Use `cves/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN.md` to add your CVE disclosures. See `cves/CVE-TEMPLATE.md` for the required format. |

>  I will update this list as soon as any new vulnerabilities are found.
